# Pentagon

~~Various bits of information are available in [docs/](docs/). You may particularly wish to review [notes.md](docs/notes.md).

Currently this spins up a cluster in only one AZ. Spreading it around will require additional thought and an eye toward [Running in Multiple Zones](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/multiple-zones/).~~

See [docs/kops.md](docs/kops.md)
