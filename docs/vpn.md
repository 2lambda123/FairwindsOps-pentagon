# VPN

## Setup
The VPN allows ssh access to intances in the private subnets in the VPC. This includes the KOPS created subnets and the private subnets created during VPC creation. 
This can be done before or after configuring and deploying your kubernetes cluster(s). It is required to have your VPC setup prior to starting VPN setup. By default an ssh key is created for the vpn instance during `pentagon start_project`. The playbook will upload the key and associate it with the new AWS instance.

* Review `account/vars.yml` and ensure that `vpc_tag_name`, `org_name`, `canonical_zone` and `vpn_bucket` are set.
* Ensure `config/local/ssh_config` has the key path and subnets set for ssh access
* In `default/resources/admin-environment/env.yml` verify the following are set properly
  - `aws_key_name` : name of the key pair created earlier
  - `default_ami` : If not preset, se the [Ubuntu AMI locator](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/). Ubuntu trusty as of this writing. Make sure it is located in correct region, instance type: `hvm:ebs-ssd`.  if needed.
  - Edit other variables as needed. VPN users to be created, aka VPN clients, are contained in the Ansible array, `openvpn_clients`
* If you haven't already, in the `$INFRASTRUCTURE_REPO` directory, install ansible requirements:

```
ansible-galaxy install -r ansible-requirements.yml
```

* Run the VPN playbook:

```
ansible-playbook default/resources/admin-environment/vpn.yml
```

* Even when all the inputs are correct, sometimes you will need to re-run ansible a couple times to get through all of the steps.


## Usage

The VPN playbook will create an instance with OpenVPN software that you can connect to using a VPN client. On OSX, one possible alternative is Tunnelblick. See: [How to connect to access server from OSX](https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs/admin-guides/183-how-to-connect-to-access-server-from-a-mac.html)


No matter the client you choose to use, the keys for each of the users will be deposited into the s3 bucket specified in `default/resources/admin-environment/env.yml` before. Download these and keep use them to access your cluster.
